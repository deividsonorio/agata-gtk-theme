# Agata GTK Theme

**v1.0.4**

Agata is a modern GTK theme featuring two carefully crafted color editions: **Nord** and **Gruvbox**. It combines elegant surfaces, balanced contrast, and distinctive color accents to provide a clean and consistent desktop experience.

- **Nord** — muted blue accents and cool blue-gray surfaces, inspired by the Nord color palette.
- **Gruvbox** — warm, earthy tones inspired by the Gruvbox color palette.

Both editions are available in Dark and Light variants.

## Features

- Two color editions: Nord and Gruvbox.
- Dark and Light variants.
- GTK 3 and GTK 4 styling.
- Desktop components for GNOME, Cinnamon, and XFCE/XFWM.
- XFCE panel and menu styling.
- Optional GTK 4/libadwaita application integration.
- Ready-to-use theme files — no compilation required.

## Installation

Download and extract the latest release, open a terminal in the extracted directory, and run:

```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

The interactive installer guides you through three simple choices:

1. Select the color edition: Nord or Gruvbox.
2. Select the variant: Dark, Light, or Both.
3. Choose whether to enable optional GTK 4/libadwaita integration.

Themes are installed locally for the current user in:

```text
~/.local/share/themes/
```

No administrator privileges or `sudo` are required.

## Command-line installation

You can also install themes directly from the terminal without using the interactive menu.

### Nord edition

Install both variants:

```bash
./install.sh install nord both
```

Install only Dark or Light:

```bash
./install.sh install nord dark
./install.sh install nord light
```

### Gruvbox edition

Install both variants:

```bash
./install.sh install gruvbox both
```

Install only Dark or Light:

```bash
./install.sh install gruvbox dark
./install.sh install gruvbox light
```

### GTK 4 / libadwaita integration

Add `--libadwaita` to an installation command to enable optional GTK 4 theme integration.

For example:

```bash
./install.sh install nord light --libadwaita
```

Or:

```bash
./install.sh install gruvbox dark --libadwaita
```

When both variants are installed, the installer asks which variant should be used for GTK 4 applications.

The installer links the selected theme's `gtk-4.0` directory to:

```text
~/.config/gtk-4.0
```

If an existing GTK 4 configuration is found, it is backed up before the link is created.

**Note:** Some libadwaita applications may restrict or partially ignore third-party GTK themes, depending on the application and libadwaita version. This option provides GTK 4 theme integration where supported, but cannot guarantee that every libadwaita application will follow all theme styles.

## Uninstallation

Use the interactive menu or remove a specific edition from the terminal.

Remove Nord:

```bash
./install.sh remove nord both
```

Remove Gruvbox:

```bash
./install.sh remove gruvbox both
```

Remove all Agata themes:

```bash
./install.sh remove all
```

To remove the optional GTK 4 configuration link and restore the previous configuration:

```bash
./install.sh remove-libadwaita
```

## Advanced options

Use a custom installation directory:

```bash
./install.sh install nord both --dest /path/to/themes
```

Display all available commands:

```bash
./install.sh --help
```

## Compatibility

Agata is designed for Linux desktop environments that support GTK themes, including GNOME, Cinnamon, and XFCE.

Appearance may vary depending on the desktop environment, GTK version, compositor, and extensions.
